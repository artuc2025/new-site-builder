# 📸 Website Cloning Workflow Prompt

You will clone a given website **pixel-perfectly** using the following automated feedback loop:

1. I will give you a URL.
2. Open the site via Playwright-MCP, take a full-page screenshot, and store it.
3. Based on the screenshot:
   - Recreate the visible layout using **Vue + Nuxt**.
   - Use **SCSS with BEM** for all styling (no Tailwind).
   - Organize components modularly and semantically.
   - Output code in a structured directory layout with `.vue`, `.scss`, and assets separated.

4. After first layout attempt:
   - Trigger a browser preview of the generated site.
   - Take a new screenshot.
   - Compare it to the original screenshot (pixel-by-pixel or visually).
   - List all visible visual differences (layout, spacing, color, font, etc.).

5. Apply corrections to code to reduce differences.

6. Maintain and update a `progress.md` file with:
   - ✅ What has been matched correctly.
   - ❌ What still differs (with screenshots or description).
   - 🛠 Planned fixes for the next iteration.

Repeat steps 4–6 until the comparison shows **zero visual differences**.

## Constraints:
- Use **Vue 3 + Nuxt 3 Composition API**.
- Use only **SCSS + BEM**, no utility classes or Tailwind.
- Keep all logic minimal — focus on structural and visual parity.
- Use semantic HTML wherever possible.
