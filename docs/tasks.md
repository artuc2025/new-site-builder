# üéØ Tasks & Progress

Track all implementation tasks with their completion status.

## üìã M1 ‚Äî Drag & Drop Canvas

- [x] Data model: add `frame { x, y, width, height }` and `zIndex`
- [x] Store: selection state and `interactionMode`
- [x] Pointer input layer: `pointerdown/move/up/cancel` with capture
- [x] Hit-testing: topmost block by `zIndex` and frame
- [x] Drag with 8px grid snapping and bounds clamping
- [x] Resize handles (N,S,E,W,NE,NW,SE,SW) with min-size
- [x] Marquee selection (rubber-band) on empty canvas drag
- [x] Keyboard: arrows (1px) and Shift+arrows (10px), Delete, Esc
 - [x] Visual aids: grid overlay toggle, selection rect and handles
- [x] Undo/redo: coalesce during interaction, commit on end
- [ ] Edge cases: high-DPI scaling, iframes overlay, 200+ blocks perf

### M1.1 ‚Äî Data model
- [x] Define `Frame` type in `@site-builder/types` (`{ x, y, width, height }`)
- [x] Extend block base type with `frame: Frame` and `zIndex: number`
- [x] Provide defaults for blocks in `@site-builder/blocks` (sensible initial sizes)
- [x] Update editor store state to include `selectedBlockIds`, `hoveredBlockId`, `interactionMode`
- [x] Add selectors: `getBlockById`
- [x] Add selectors: `getTopmostAtPoint`, `getBlocksInRect`
 - [x] Add util helper: `snapToGrid(8)`
 - [x] Add util helper: `clampToCanvas`
 - [ ] Add util helper: `coalesceHistory`
- [x] Ensure Immer-based immutable updates for move/resize primitives
- [ ] Backfill existing pages/seed to include `frame` and `zIndex`

### M1.2 ‚Äî Pointer and Selection
- [x] Click selection (single/multi with Shift)
- [x] Hover highlight on blocks
- [x] Empty-area click clears selection
- [x] Marquee selection with overlay rectangle
- [x] Group drag when multiple selected (click on any selected)

### M1.3 ‚Äî Drag Move
- [x] Pointer capture and drag-start state
- [x] Absolute updates from initial frames (no compounding)
- [x] Snap to 8px grid during move
- [x] Clamp origin to canvas bounds (x,y ‚â• 0)
- [x] One-step history commit on release

### M1.4 ‚Äî Resize (next)
- [x] Display resize handles for single selection
- [x] Start resize with pointer capture and handle direction
- [x] Apply size deltas with min-size constraints
- [x] Snap edges to 8px grid and clamp to canvas
- [x] Commit one history step on release

### M1.5 ‚Äî Keyboard (next)
- [x] Arrow keys nudge 1px; Shift+Arrow nudge 10px
- [x] Delete removes selection; Esc clears selection
- [x] Coalesce nudges into single history step while key held

### M1.6 ‚Äî Visual Aids (next)
- [x] Grid overlay toggle
- [x] Selection rectangle and handle styling
- [x] Basic alignment guides (non-magnetic)

### M1.7 ‚Äî Edge Cases & QA (next)
- [ ] HiDPI/zoom correctness of pointer coords and snapping
- [ ] Interaction overlay for media/iframes
- [ ] Perf sanity with 200+ blocks
- [x] Smoke test: render frames in canvas positioning (no interactions yet)

Plan:
- Introduce canvas scale/zoom and world coordinates; normalize pointer coords; make snap/grid/guides scale‚Äëaware. Validate at DPR 1.25/1.5/2.
- Add interaction overlay for media/iframes during drag/resize/marquee to prevent event stealing.
- Performance for ‚â•200 blocks: rAF throttle pointermove; ephemeral preview for drag/resize; maintain id‚Üíindex map; benchmark jank/FPS.
- Helpers/history: implement `coalesceHistory` util and drop empty steps.
- Toggles & UX after stabilization: Snap toggle + threshold, Guides toggle, Preview mode.
- Seed/backfill last: add `frame`/`zIndex` to seeds/existing pages after stabilization.

**Status**: In progress  
**Exit Criteria**: Blocks can be selected, dragged and resized with 8px snapping; keyboard nudging works; undo/redo preserves interactions without extra steps

Notes:
- Keep each change minimal and shippable; update `docs/enhancements.md` after each.
- Default behaviors should match current UX unless explicitly toggled.

### Manual Test Checklist ‚Äî Snap Toggle

1) Default On:
- Add a block; drag it. Movement snaps to 8px; guides appear near other blocks.
- Resize a block; edges snap to 8px.

2) Toggle Off:
- Click ‚ÄúSnap: On‚Äù to turn Off. Drag: movement is pixel-perfect, no guides.
- Resize: smooth pixel changes, no 8px rounding.

3) Edge Cases:
- Multi-select drag respects toggle state (no guides/snaps when Off).
- Keyboard nudges remain 1px/10px (toggle does not affect keyboard).
- Preview mode disables toolbar effects on interactions.
